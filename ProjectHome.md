I made this helper widget to help me troubleshoot my nunchuk-to-joystick converter in Linux.
Upon start-up, it will list the available joysticks, as well as their axes and buttons.  It has the option to update the axes inputs via progress bars and the buttons through check boxes periodically.
It uses SDL to communicate to the joystick, it will compile for Linux and Windows - I haven't tested Mac.
